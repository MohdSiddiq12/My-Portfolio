                <p>Hi there! I'm Mohammed Siddiq. I recently graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Science, 
                specializing in AI and Machine Learning, from Siddhartha Institute of Technology and Science.</p>

                <p>I am passionate about AI, ML, NLP, and Deep Learning, and I continuously seek to explore 
                new technological horizons. During my studies, I completed an internship at Ignitus, where I 
                contributed to the Learning Management System (LMS) project and focused on house pricing 
                prediction models.</p>

                <p>I'm currently looking for opportunities in ML, Data Science, and AI roles where I can 
                apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects.</p>
